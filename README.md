This game is not yet finished but it is my attempt at an endless runner for mobile. My assets and such were downloaded from a lesson plan on youtube and from there I tried to do all the code myself. I have run into a few issues mainly with the obstacles but it is very close to being done and will be completed soon. I enjoyed making this project because it helped me a lot with obstacle spawning at random. It was a good mix of challenging but also fun enough to not make me want to rip my hair out from my struggles. This has also helped me with widget pop ups for things such as menu's and game score going forward.
